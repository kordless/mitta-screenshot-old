Installation
------------
You may install a developer version of this software by [downloading the zip file](https://github.com/kordless/mitta-screenshot/releases/download/alpha-1/screenshotter.zip) and uncompressing it on your local drive.

In the Chrome menus, click on "more tools" and the "extensions" menu item. In the extensions view, enable "developer mode" by using the slider at the top right. Click "load unpacked" in the top left and then navigate into the uncompressed *mitta-screenshot* folder.


Click "select folder" to load the extension. Click the Extensions icon (a puzzle piece) in the top right corner of the browser and then click the pin icon next to the Mitta Screenshot extension. This will display the > icon in the browser.

You may also be able to find the extension on the Chrome store, but it won't be regularly published until we launch and have finished testing and quality assurance on the plugin and site. Try to use the developer version!

Use
---
To use the extension, navigate to a page and then click on the > icon to save and index the page. You can use the terminal console on Mitta to search for the page by term. Any word found on the page by the machine learning model will be in the index!

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggstions!
